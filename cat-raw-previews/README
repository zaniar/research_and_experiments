Tiny utility (libraw wrapper) to extract full frame preview from raw photos and concatenate it in one file.
This can help sometime to make previews of time lapse video. Or make fun video from your large photo collection.

cat-raw-previews reads file names from stdin and output jpeg previews to stdout

Tested with CR2 format only.

Examples: 

# Play your photos with mplayer: 
find -iname '*CR2' | ./cat-raw-previews | mplayer - -nosound -fps 25 -demuxer lavf -lavfdopts format=mjpeg -vf dsize=1280:-3,scale=1280:-3

# Save preview from CR2:
echo IMG_0001.CR2 | ./cat-raw-previews > preview.jpg

# find all CR2 and make avi from it (with ffmpeg) without temp files
find ~/photos -type f -name '*.CR2' | ./cat-raw-previews | ffmpeg -f image2pipe -r 25 -vcodec mjpeg -i - -vf scale=1920:-1 -qmin 1 -qmax 1 -c:v mjpeg ~/Desktop/test.avi
