Please use pixilang v1.6 to run this stuff

You can get it from:

P.S.
All 3d models are generated, but I have some troubles with fixed point in pixilang
and I don't have much time to fix it. Well, I have generated this objects in C++ and save arrays
of vertexes in "data/" directory. Sorry for that...
